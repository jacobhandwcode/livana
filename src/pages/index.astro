        <h2 class="about-title animate-fade-up">My Journey to Authenticity</h2>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.1s;">
          For much of my life, I lived in survival mode — constantly doing,
          managing, and holding things together. I was capable, responsible, and
          dependable, yet internally I felt anxious and overwhelmed, under quiet
          but relentless pressure. I didn’t yet realize how much of my life was
          being driven by effort rather than alignment, by survival rather than
          presence.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
          That quiet undercurrent stayed with me into adulthood, even as I
          pursued my Master’s in Social Work, got married, and began building a
          family. From the outside, I was fully functioning and progressing —
          professionally and personally. I was capable, productive, and
          responsible. And yet internally, I felt anxious, insecure, and
          detached, unsure why life felt so flat despite everything I had built.
          I kept moving forward, hoping that the next milestone would bring a
          sense of arrival, without realizing that I was still disconnected from
          parts of myself that had never been given space to be felt.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
          Over time, my body began to reflect what I hadn’t yet allowed myself
          to feel — through headaches, neck pain, stiffness, and a general sense
          of tightness. These weren’t problems to solve, but invitations to slow
          down and listen. As I did, it became clear that beneath the
          productivity and strength was a reservoir of unexpressed emotion —
          grief, resentment, fear, and exhaustion — waiting not for effort or
          analysis, but for safety.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
          The healing came through allowing myself to be seen and held in a
          space of safety and love — both through the presence of others and
          through learning how to offer that same kind of witnessing to myself.
          In that kind of presence, what had long been held could begin to move,
          supported and contained. Through this process, I came to understand
          that healing isn’t about fixing what’s wrong with us, but about
          allowing what has been silenced to move, safely and with care — until
          our truth, vitality, and wholeness can be felt again.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
          And with that came something I hadn’t known how to access before:
          flow. A sense of alignment. Moments of real joy and aliveness. Life
          began to move with me rather than against me. There was more ease,
          more presence, and even moments of quiet ecstasy — the deep relief of
          no longer fighting myself.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
          As I moved through this painful and profoundly transformative process,
          a quiet knowing emerged: this journey wasn’t meant to be mine alone. I
          felt called to offer others the kind of space I had received — a place
          where the work between survival and thriving could unfold with care
          and support.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">
          Now, as a soul doula, I hold space for those moving through grief,
          burnout, anxiety, and emotional awakening — especially those who
          appear successful on the outside but long for something more real,
          more vibrant, and more aligned within. My work is grounded in the
          wisdom I’ve lived: that true healing happens not when we are fixed,
          but when we are held — with gentleness, love, and the deep remembering
          that we were never broken to begin with.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
          This is the heart of what I offer: soul-deep presence, intuitive
          guidance, and the loving support that allows you to return to your own
          light.

          <h3 class="service-title">Connection</h3>
          <p class="service-description">
            True connection — with ourselves and with the Divine — begins when
            we allow ourselves to fully recognize and honor our emotions. Rather
            than searching for the Divine outside of us, we come to see that it
            is already woven into every part of our lived experience: our
            bodies, our feelings, and our inner knowing. When we create space to
            feel what is present, we deepen our relationship with ourselves.
            From that place of self-connection, our capacity to sense guidance,
            trust our intuition, and walk in relationship with the Divine
            naturally expands.

          <p class="service-description">
            Alignment is the experience of living in harmony with yourself —
            when your emotions, body, and spirit are in conversation with one
            another, and your inner life is reflected in how you move through
            the world. When you are aligned, there is less force and more flow.
            You trust your internal guidance, allow emotions to move without
            resistance, and meet life with a sense of openness rather than
            control. From this place, clarity arises naturally, and your choices
            begin to feel rooted, authentic, and true to who you are. Alignment
            is not something to achieve — it is something to return to.

          <h3 class="service-title">Embodiment</h3>
          <p class="service-description">
            Embodiment is the practice of allowing emotions to be felt fully,
            without suppression, avoidance, or numbing. Rather than seeing
            emotions as obstacles to healing or spirituality, embodiment honors
            them as essential messengers. When emotions are given space to
            surface and move, they bring clarity, release, and deeper
            self-trust. Through embodiment, we learn to live from within our
            bodies rather than over them — reconnecting with the wisdom that is
            already present and allowing our inner life to guide our outer
            expression.

          Professional Journey
        </h2>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
          I earned my Master’s in Social Work with a specialty in addictions
          from Long Island University in 2013, where I developed a deep
          understanding of human behavior and the complexities of addiction and
          recovery. The following year, I completed an intensive, year-long
          clinical training in Family Systems at the Family Institute at Neve
          Yerushalayim, deepening my awareness of how family dynamics shape
          individual experience and the healing process.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
          Alongside formal training, my work has been shaped by a lifelong
          commitment to inner exploration and emotional healing. Through my own
          lived process, I came to understand that guiding others requires more
          than knowledge alone — it requires embodiment. This ongoing dedication
          to personal growth remains central to my work, informing how I listen,
          how I hold space, and how I meet others with empathy and presence.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
          Drawing from this foundation of education, clinical experience, and
          lived wisdom, I offer grounded, practical support to help you
          reconnect with your authentic self and move forward with greater
          clarity and steadiness.
        </p>

          self-discovery, I invite you to reach out and start a conversation.

            I've shared have been thoughtfully analyzed, validated, and reframed
            in a healthy, constructive way. I call her 'home' because she helps
            me tap into my inner strength and sense of safety. She makes me feel
