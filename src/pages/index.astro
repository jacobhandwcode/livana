        <h2 class="about-title animate-fade-up">My Journey to Authenticity</h2>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.1s;">
          For as long as I can remember, I carried a quiet belief that something
          was fundamentally wrong with me. Beneath the surface, it shaped how I
          moved through the world — wrapped in shame, masked by perfectionism,
          and driven by a deep fear of being truly seen.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
          When I was thirteen, I went to summer camp — an experience that should
          have been joyful, but instead left me feeling isolated and
          overwhelmed. I was homesick and silently struggling, too ashamed of my
          emotions to let anyone in. Each night, I cried myself to sleep, hidden
          behind a brave face, unsure whether it was safe to be honest about how
          I felt.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
          Things didn't get easier when I returned home. Puberty brought a deep
          discomfort with my body, and I began secretly turning to dieting and
          control — trying to shape myself into something more "acceptable." I
          longed to feel like I belonged, like I was enough. I believed that if
          I could meet the world's expectations, maybe I would finally feel
          worthy within myself.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
          That longing stayed with me into adulthood, even as I pursued my
          Master's in Social Work. On the outside, I was achieving — checking
          all the boxes. But on the inside, I was anxious and disconnected. I
          kept striving, hoping that success would fill the emptiness, but the
          deeper truth was that I was still running from the parts of me I had
          never allowed to be seen.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
          Then, one morning, everything came to a halt. I woke up unable to lift
          my head — my neck had completely locked up. It was frightening, and
          deeply humbling. As I sought help to heal my body, I began to
          understand: this wasn't just physical pain. It was the weight of years
          of unexpressed emotion. The tension, the stiffness, the immobility —
          it was my body's way of telling the truth I hadn't yet spoken.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
          That moment cracked something open.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">
          For the first time, I began to feel what I had long avoided — the
          grief, the shame, the fear, the anger. I didn't do it alone. I was
          held in a space of deep, unconditional love and presence. A space
          where I was safe to feel everything, without judgment. And in that
          sacred container, I began to heal.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
          Healing, I came to understand, isn't about fixing what's broken. It's
          about allowing. About meeting ourselves fully — even in the messy,
          painful places — with compassion. What I discovered was life-changing:
          when we give ourselves permission to feel, we unlock something
          essential. We reconnect with our truth. We remember our wholeness.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.9s;">
          As I moved through this painful but profound transformation, a quiet
          knowing emerged: this journey wasn't just mine. I wasn't meant to walk
          it only for myself. I felt called to offer the kind of space I had
          been given — a space of tenderness, presence, and trust — to others
          who are seeking their way back to themselves.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 1.0s;">
          Now, as a soul doula, I hold space for people moving through grief,
          burnout, anxiety, and emotional awakening. I guide individuals who
          feel unseen, unheard, or disconnected — and I support those who are
          successful on the outside but longing for something more real, more
          vibrant, and more aligned within.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 1.1s;">
          My work is grounded in the wisdom I've lived: that true healing
          happens not when we are fixed, but when we are held — with gentleness,
          with love, and with the deep remembering that we were never broken to
          begin with.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 1.2s;">
          This is the heart of what I offer: soul-deep presence, intuitive
          guidance, and the loving support that allows you to return to your own
          light.

          <p class="service-description">
            True connection with ourselves and the Divine comes when we fully
            recognize our emotions and the wisdom they bring. Instead of looking
            for the Divine outside of us, we realize that it's already woven
            into every part of us—our emotions, bodies, and inner knowing. By
            allowing ourselves to feel and honor our emotions, we become more in
            touch with our true selves, which opens the door to a deeper
            connection with the Divine. The more we understand and accept
            ourselves, the more we can clearly hear and follow the guidance that
            comes from within.

          <p class="service-description">
            Spiritual alignment is about living in true harmony with
            yourself—where your emotions, body, and spirit are in sync, and your
            thoughts, feelings, and actions reflect your deepest values. It's
            the clarity and confidence that comes from being fully connected to
            your inner guidance and authentic self. When you're aligned, you
            allow your emotions to flow, trust the process of life, and
            surrender to what's unfolding. This deep connection leads you toward
            your soul's purpose, bringing you lasting peace, joy, and
            fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p class="service-description">
            Imagine living in a way that feels effortless, authentic, and true
            to who you are. Spiritual alignment helps you tune into your
            emotions and inner wisdom, guiding you toward a life that's not only
            meaningful but deeply aligned with your highest potential.

          <h3 class="service-title">Embodiment</h3>
          <p class="service-description">
            Spiritual embodiment involves allowing oneself to fully experience
            and feel emotions in their entirety. Rather than suppressing,
            avoiding, or numbing difficult emotions, this approach encourages
            giving them the space to surface and flow. In doing so, we honor the
            natural movement of feelings, which, when allowed to fully express,
            can bring deeper clarity and healing. Emotions, in this sense, are
            not obstacles to our spiritual or emotional growth, but are
            essential signals that guide us back to greater alignment with our
            deepest inner wisdom and authentic self-expression.

          Professional Journey
        </h2>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
          I earned my Master's in Social Work with a specialty in addictions
          from Long Island University in 2013, where I developed a deep
          understanding of human behavior and the complexities of addiction
          recovery. The following year, I completed an intensive, year-long
          clinical training in Family Systems at the Family Institute at Neve
          Yerushalayim. This experience enriched my awareness of how family
          dynamics profoundly shape individual well-being and the healing
          process.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
          Yet, my truest growth has blossomed through a lifelong commitment to
          inner work. As I embarked on my own journey of emotional healing and
          self-discovery, I realized that to guide others authentically, I
          needed to embody the transformation I wished to inspire. This
          dedication to personal evolution remains at the core of my practice,
          infusing my work with empathy, presence, and insight.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
          With this foundation of education, clinical experience, and personal
          growth, I offer grounded, practical support that empowers you to
          reconnect with your authentic self and move forward with clarity and
          strength.

            session with a sense of lightness, knowing that the heavy emotions
            I've shared have been thoughtfully analyzed, validated, and reframed
            in a healthy, constructive way. I call her 'home' because she helps
            me tap into my inner strength and sense of safety. She makes me feel

            not for her. I could literally write a ten-page paper on all the
            things I've learned from her. She's a wellspring of knowledge,
            insight, and unconditional support, and I truly know she has the
            unique ability to help others grow and thrive in ways they could
            never even imagine.
